Instructions:
Create a project and build out the HTML and CSS 
to match as close as possible to the design file.

You may need to Google CSS background images for 
the first section of content with the headings
Learn. Create. Repeat over the top.

Use this as an opportunity to practice definiing 
HTML content and stucture, CSS colours and fonts
box model, float, clear, clearfix, grids and maybe
even some positioning.

For the text, you can use a lorem ipsum generator
like this one: https://getlorem.com/ Or use the 
Sublime shortcut lorem<tab>.

Good luck!
